## Working papers

### Climate, Pollution and Endogenous Retirement  
Abstract: Environmental degradation alters labor supply through mortality risk, productivity loss, and
the disutility of working under adverse conditions. This paper develops a dynamic life-cycle
framework in continuous time in which retirement arises endogenously, shaped by agents’
choices over health effort, environmental abatement, and labor supply. A distinct mechanism is
introduced: workers experience direct disutility from supplying labor in polluted environments,
which can induce earlier retirement even when health and income remain stable. The model
shows that abatement systematically postpones retirement by reducing exposure, whereas health
effort produces a more nuanced effect—it can either extend or shorten working life depending
on how it interacts with environmental decisions. This finding qualifies the common view that
health investment unambiguously delays retirement, highlighting instead that the relationship
depends critically on environmental conditions. Calibration to U.S. data illustrates the model’s
quantitative implications: consumption and abatement follow opposite U-shaped patterns over
the life cycle, health expenditure rises steeply with age, and the value of environmental quality
declines toward retirement. These insights are general and offer a new lens on how pollution,
health investment, and retirement interact.

### Endogenous Retirement under a Pandemic  
Abstract: We study the joint determination of consumption, health expenditure, and retirement age
under pandemic shocks in a life-cycle framework. The model endogenizes health expenditure,
consumption and retirement decisions while accounting for the effects of a pandemic on mortality,
labor disutility, and wages. Analytical results characterize the conditions under which a pandemic
leads to an increase in retirement age, identifying how agents optimally adjust labor supply
and health spending in response to elevated mortality risk. Numerical simulations complement
these findings, illustrating that for certain pandemic intensities and timings, retirement age may
instead decrease, particularly for younger agents with substantial remaining working life. The
simulations further reveal that pandemics disproportionately affect older individuals, inducing
higher health expenditures and later retirement, while early-life pandemics produce milder
effects. Together, the analytical and numerical results provide a comprehensive view of the
asymmetric impacts of pandemics across age groups, with implications for health and retirement
policy.

### Occupational Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: A Life-Cycle Model  
Abstract: We extend a dynamic life-cycle model of endogenous retirement in which individuals choose
consumption, health expenditure, and the timing of retirement to incorporate occupational
heterogeneity through differential vulnerability to extreme weather condition such as severe heat
bouts, which raises the disutility of labor effort in occupation-specific ways. Health investments
influence survival probabilities, while the retirement decision balances the utility from continued
labor income against the rising disutility of work and the value of leisure. We derive analytical
conditions characterizing optimal consumption, health expenditure, and retirement, and examine
how occupational vulnerability to extreme heat shapes retirement age and welfare. The
framework highlights the interaction of health, survival, and retirement in the presence of
climate-induced labor disutility, offering implications for welfare analysis and adaptation policy.
