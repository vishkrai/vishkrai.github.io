## Working papers

### Climate, Pollution and Endogenous Retirement  
This paper studies how pollution-induced health deterioration affects retirement decisions and abatement incentives. Using a dynamic life-cycle framework with endogenous health effort, it quantifies welfare and policy implications.

### Endogenous Retirement under a Pandemic  
A macro–life-cycle model of health investment, consumption, and retirement when mortality risk is driven by pandemic conditions. The analysis highlights behavioral adjustment and optimal policy in environments with high epidemiological uncertainty.

### Occupational Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: A Life-Cycle Model  
This work incorporates occupation-specific exposure to extreme heat into standard retirement models. It shows how differential vulnerability shapes labor effort, retirement timing, and welfare dispersion across workers.
