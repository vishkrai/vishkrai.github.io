I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the **Indian Statistical Institute – Delhi**, specializing in **life-cycle and macroeconomic modeling** under environmental and epidemiological risks. Prior to this, I completed my **Master’s in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics (DSE)**, where I built a strong foundation in advanced economic theory and quantitative methods. 
My research combines **dynamic optimization**, **heterogeneous-agent models**, and **quantitative macroeconomic simulations**, with a focus on how climate, pollution, and pandemics shape labor, retirement, and welfare outcomes.
