## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, where I work at the intersection of life-cycle dynamics, macroeconomic modeling, and environmental risks. My research examines how climate change, pollution, and epidemiological shocks affect labor markets, retirement decisions, health investment, and long-run welfare.

Before joining ISI Delhi, I earned my Master’s in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), where I developed a strong grounding in economic theory, dynamic methods, and empirical analysis.

My current work combines dynamic optimization, structural life-cycle modeling, and quantitative simulations to study how individuals adapt to environmental and health-related risks across occupations and over the life course.
