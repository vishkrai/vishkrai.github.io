_Ph.D. Candidate in Economics_  
Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi

## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the **Indian Statistical Institute – Delhi**, specializing in **life-cycle and macroeconomic modeling** under environmental and epidemiological risks. Prior to this, I completed my **Master’s in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics (DSE)**, where I built a strong foundation in advanced economic theory and quantitative methods. 
My research combines **dynamic optimization**, **heterogeneous-agent models**, and **quantitative macroeconomic simulations**, with a focus on how climate, pollution, and pandemics shape labor, retirement, and welfare outcomes.

## Research

### Climate, Pollution and Endogenous Retirement  
This paper studies how pollution-induced health deterioration affects retirement decisions and abatement incentives. Using a dynamic life-cycle framework with endogenous health effort, it quantifies welfare and policy implications.

### Endogenous Retirement under a Pandemic  
A macro–life-cycle model of health investment, consumption, and retirement when mortality risk is driven by pandemic conditions. The analysis highlights behavioral adjustment and optimal policy in environments with high epidemiological uncertainty.

### Occupational Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: A Life-Cycle Model  
This work incorporates occupation-specific exposure to extreme heat into standard retirement models. It shows how differential vulnerability shapes labor effort, retirement timing, and welfare dispersion across workers.
